As part of bonus phase, i implemented the open source messaging interface 'rabbitMQ'. 

RabbitMQ is a messaging interface which provides number of advantages when it comes to consistency and scalability of the application.
Messages are routed through exchanges before arriving at queues. RabbitMQ features several built-in exchange types for typical routing logic. 

For this application i have created 3 different queues for 3 different operations. Each queue will hold the request/response messages to and from nodeJS server to MongoDB server.
By which i can decouple the server and in future it will be easy to horizontaly scale the application.
